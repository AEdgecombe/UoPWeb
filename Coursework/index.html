    Matt explaining single page apps
    Load the example and explore the code
    one index html page, header main footer, template hidden class css
    content of main to change on button click nav, show/hide
    class change on button click 
    store user info on server
    login status stored on client
    http is stateless, don't use state on server
    send id of user so server sends back details
    AUTH for extra marks
    users js with user data and functions with retrieve and update info, has static and
    serves client api roots
    push url onto browser so can use back button, no request to server
    only request on enter push 
    functions to get handles on elements stored in array of references
    building a framework for a single page app
    screens with unique names
    using dataset not id because id can be the same on two elements
    won't have to use querySelector will be in array
    idea of building an app from blank to content based on how many app pages
    build content is called on blank pages, pages should be blank and then content function
    called
    screens with inc files for each screen
    screens built
    buttons have event listeners to switch screen 
    want to hide every class of screen and show corresponding to button clicked
    hide all screens function, show function on event
    on load hide all screens and show home screen
    change title of pages
    client's job to render pages
    do not store application state server side
